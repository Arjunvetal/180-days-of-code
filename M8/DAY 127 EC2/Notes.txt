=============================

- When ever EC 2 stops public IP will be changed and hence we will have to download RDP file each time we restart the EC2!


- SO far we have learnt how to create and access windows EC2

- EC2 Public IP 
- username
- password


Download SSH clients any of th e below :
Linux SSH
Putty
Moboxterm
Windows SSH



Remote Login :
RDP - Remote Desktop protocol 
Its in the NV and we are here in mumbai so remote login

To login we need IP of ECE and user name and password!


=> PASSWORD CAN BE EASILY HACKED WITH Brute Force algorithm with various possible combinations of letters digits and symbols!


.PEM FILE => PRIVATE kEY

=> To remote login for any linux

=> ssh -i <Private key path> username@public i/p

username for amazon linux is : ec2-user


username guide :

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html

make privat ekey read only as even if any signle character added tothe key will destroy that key!

chmod 400 key_name.pm

ec2-user


User session-> right click -> edit session > change the IP

We can also do remote login with the MobaXterm_Personal_22.1 appliaction!

=============================

Cloud Security :

Firewall :
=> Inbound and Outbound rules : 

AWS
Security group  

-> EC2 has firewall {windows}

Incoming traffic ill go to security groups first and then after checking whether its following  the rules or not its entry will be allowed!

Port 22 : When we use SSH PORT 22 IS UTILISED AND Opened

Edit Inbound Rules :
- To limit the acess to the EC2

Network Setting :
Select existing security groups :

LAB : 
- Make an EC-2, Windows!
- Install tomcat
- Deploy web app in tomcat
- If needed open tomcat port in ASW security group


Access from any laptop with below URL :
<public-ip> : <portno> / application 


Cloud trail and cloud watch : service used to track and maintains the logs


=============================
=> RDS : Relational Database service 

Connectivity
YES - TO ACCESS IT OUTSIDE OF THE AWS

PASSWORD : 1xITmjVx0H7uwJeZzi1f


In MySQL Client : // created while creating RDS

IP Address : database-1.cgdcsygolpzt.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Username : admin 
Password : 1xITmjVx0H7uwJeZzi1f



=> DBeaver 
Used for all RDBMS 



=============================

=> EC2 Charges :
- Eevn fi we stop EC2 isntance then also we gets charged for using HD as RAM and CPOU will be freed for other users but then the ROM in which we are storing the data is not freed and kept for us when to start EC2 again!

- So we are charges for the storage which is very minimal almost .0001 $ per GB for 24 hrs

- and also we are charges for the license of OS in case of windows which is kept in the ROM!

- for the linux we are not charged!

=> RDS costing
Mysql -> Free
ram/cpu -> Free
Storage -> Charged


=============================
=> Tomcat deploy : 
- https://www.baeldung.com/tomcat-deploy-war


=============================

=> Security Groups
Inboud calls
Outbound calls

=> Deploy the application on EC2 with the help of tomcat

=> Elastci IP 

=============================


IQ : Is Cloud secure ?
- Secuirty depends on developer
- Cloud just gaurantee service is running
- security groups and VPC configurations is completely given to the developers!
