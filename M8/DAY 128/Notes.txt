DAY 3 :
=======================

Benifits of Cloud : 

- Cost effective - due to pay-as-you-go
- Remote access at any time from any where!
- User Friendly
- On demand supply of services
- Fast Deployment (Cloud Services can start in a minutes)
- Scalability
- Elasticity - Flexibility ( in choosing and using various services ) [ Easy to aquire alot of infra for a short period ]
eg. Earlier companies had to purchase servers on a lease by paying huge amount from Oracle, IBM etc. With AWS can get servers easily and use whatever way we want them
- Outsourced Management, prpvides or handels administration role
- Reliability and security! 99.999999% gaurantee!

=======================

=> Scale Up and Scale Down 

- Resources increasing and decraeasing based on demand and supply!

AWS Console : 

Select EC2 : Stop instance to Scale

Actions - Insatcne Setting - Change Instance Type - Select Type from dropdown!

We can not Change Instance Type unless our Insatnce has stopped!

=======================

=> EBS : Volume : Elastic Block Store
- We can create volume without EC2
- We can seperateely attach the instance to the volume created!

-----------------------------------------

Create Volume :
- Create volumeInfo - gp2  - size 20 GB - Availability Zone (same as an EC2 insatnce availibility zone) - Create Volume 
-----------------------------------------

Select Volume - Action - attach volume 
-----------------------------------------

Select Volume - Action - deattach volume(make sure EC2 is stopped)
-----------------------------------------

Note : 

Volume must be in the same availability zone in which EC2 is present!

So if the volume and EC2 AZ is diff then we wont be able to add it

So while creating the volume select the Availability Zone!

- AWS has diff regions.
- Each region has got the Availability Zone.
Availability Zone - Incase any data center gets down so other will be active!

-----------------------------------------
=> Disk Management in EC2 
- Search in EC2 - Create and Format HardDisk Partitions

- Here the external Volume would be offline so make it online by right click on it!
- Close that window once and again open it!
- It will ask to initialise so cancel it first and then right click on that ext volume and initialise it!

-----------------------------------------

Detach Volume:

- again to detach the volume EC2 must have stopped
- Yet we can forced detach the volume!

We can not detach the C drive volume from EC2 as it will cause EC2 to stop working as OS is installed in C drive

=======================
=> S3 Service :
- S3 is way to better than Google Drive
- Cheapest Service - Storage
1. Used for storage
2. S3 Quries on JSON and csv data can be run
- We can query our data and at runtime data is presented in tabular form!
- Mainly used for big data
- data in the forms of json is queried with S3 select
3. Run static websites


Bucket - root directory (Unique name globally)
- folders (objects)
- files (objects)

- These objects are immutable.

#Name of the bucket must be unique globaly!

but then sub files anf folders inside the bucket can be same which name is been used for buckets globally!

- Bucket name must not contain uppercase characters

- bucket name cdac is not available:

=> To upload the files in parent of bucket.

We can host the static website an dynamic websites (only of react) on S3 service!

----------------------------------------
=> S3 select :

S3 Queries : Notre here N is the Column Number starts from 1 to n!

SELECT * FROM s3object s LIMIT 5

SELECT * FROM s3object s where s._2 like '%a%'

SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM s3object s

SELECT * FROM s3object s WHERE s._N = 'xyz'

SELECT * FROM s3object s WHERE s._N like '%xyz%'

SELECT * FROM s3object s WHERE CAST(s._N as INTEGER) = 1234

SELECT * FROM s3object s WHERE CAST(s._N as FLOAT) > 12.34

SELECT count(*) FROM s3object s

SELECT s.key1 FROM S3Object s

SELECT s.array1[0].key1 FROM S3Object s

----------------------------------------

Output setting :

Output settings
- Format
CSV  - check this for tabular format
JSON

- CSV delimiter
Comma
Tab
Custom

----------------------------------------

TO UPLOAD FILE AND ACCESS WITH THE LINKS :

First create the bucket with the global unique name :


=> With the link to give public access : 
GoTo Permission : 
1. Block public access (bucket settings)
Must be Turned Off!

Block all public access - unselect checkbox

2.Object OwnershipInfo
ACLs enabled and Save Changes

Now copy URL link which can be shared publically with anyone!
