TODO:
1. role of web/http server
2. difference between web server and web container
3. what is the role of servlet/jsp
4. what are the steps for writing and running a servlet/jsp

5. what is the role of HTTP protocol and how it works?
So HTTP protocols are nothing but the set of rules like to doGet into doPost

File transfer : 
Over the Internet there are multiple protocols available FTP protocol is there 
it's a file transfer protocol 

//Deployment : 
We will upload all our files on the web server via FTP which includes uploading of all the files.


Protocols for exchanging email between client and server :
POP3 and SMTP protocols and IMP protocol

6. What are different methods of HTTP protocol (GET, POST, ...)
7. What is the difference between GET and POST method of HTTP protocol
ANS : 
via get method we can send data via URL and the body or payload

via post we have the body to send the data via..
url is not used to send the data

Limitation of get method : we can send only 2 KB to 8 KB of data via get method but then there is no restriction on the date assigned by the post method

- None of them are secured

Request and response has got the two part:
Headers / MetaData
Body / Payload

doPost will take little bit more time to read the data from client or server than doGet



8. What is Servlet interface? What is GenericServlet? What is HttpServlet?


9. What is the life-cycle of a Servlet?



10. What is the life-cycle of a JSP?


=> Path of the servlet from JSP file :
C:\CDAC\Github\Assignments\M6\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\tmp0\work\Catalina\localhost\MyWebApp\org\apache\jsp

JSP internally translated into the Servlet and then it follows similar life cycle!

11. What is ServletConfig? What is ServletContext?
	If possible, try some program on it on your own

TODO:
Write one servlet which will fetch the records from customer table and display the same
Similarly write the JSP version of the above code
