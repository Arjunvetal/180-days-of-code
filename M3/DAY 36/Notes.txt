========================
=> Best Case (Omega) | Worst Case (BigO) | Average case (Theta)

========================
=> Linear Search:
- for Linear search we cn work with the sorted or unsorted array:

=> Binary Search:
- For binary search we need sorted array compulsarily:
- Works on devide and conquer rule
- devide array into two parts with low(start index), high(index index) and mid((low+high)/2)
- 
========================
1.Create an aray and display it for n numbers n is no of elements in array

2.Crerate an array of characters and convert it into String

3.Creat and arrat and search a key value accepted from user

4.Implement the binary and linear search alog for array
