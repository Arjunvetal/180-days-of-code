/*Recursive program to print formula for GCD of n integers. 
		Given a function gcd(a, b) to find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two number. It is also known that GCD of three elements can be found by 		    gcd(a, gcd(b, c)), similarly for four element it can find the GCD by gcd(a, gcd(b, gcd(c, d))). Given a positive integer n. The task is print the formula to find the GCD of n integer using given gcd() function.
		Examples: 

		Input : n = 3
		Output : gcd(int, gcd(int, int))

		Input : n = 5
		Output : gcd(int, gcd(int, gcd(int, gcd(int, int))))
