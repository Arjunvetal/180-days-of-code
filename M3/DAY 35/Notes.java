Algorithm and Data Structures
=============================
Problem Definition => Alogrithm => Data Structure => Program
=============================
Algorithm :
- the finite set of instructions which are being carried in 
a specific order to perform the specific task.

Characteristics of Algorithm:
1.Input - There must be at least one input either at compile 
tiime or at run time
2.Output- Based on input 1/more O/P will generate
3.Unambiguity - There must not be unambiguity
4.Effectiveness - 
5.Finiteness - 


We need algorithms because of the following reasons:
Scalability
Performance


=============================
Array :
- finite,ordered,homogeneous
- upper bound (end of array) and lower bound(startgin array 
element postion)


Computer Architect give beter clearity on mapping of elements in 
the memory
Address(A[i]) = M + (i-L)*8
Size(A)= U-L+1
m => Starting location of an Array
L =>Lower bound
u => upper bound
w=> size of the data type


SPARSE MATRIX : MATRIX WHICH has only 0 and 1 as an element
twoD array with the majority of the elements as null

row major order
column major order

HW:
Diff between liner and non liner: 
Short note on ADT:
